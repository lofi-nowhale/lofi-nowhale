<h1>Noelle Hemphill | Backend Engineer | Fort Collins, CO</h1>

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Noelle (@lofi-nowhale)! I am a logic-loving software engineer who loves learning and adventuring! I've recently embarked on a new adventure in the world of Software Development thanks to the Turing School of Software and Design. Since starting in June 2023, I've found a true love of code and have been enjoying learning about everything from the Ruby Fundamentals to microservices and monoliths!
I'm fueled by the desire to write great code and contribute to my community as a woman in tech! 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript and Python!
